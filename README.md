# Malicious-URL-Detection
Malicious URL detection algorithm based on Deep Learning.
This is the CS315 project, aim to find a good way to detect the malicious URL.

We have done the Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines(SVM) part. The dataset is from [exp-db](https://github.com/exp-db/AI-Driven-WAF)

We extract the URL feature by TF-IDF（Term Frequency-InversDocument Frequency）which also was mentioned by [exp-db](https://github.com/exp-db/AI-Driven-WAF) and count some special key words such as "<\script>, name"

we have explored the CNN approach to deal with this case.




There are some sample codes for other Blogs or tutorials  I will cite them as soon as possible, if I find the authors.
